# Analytics Vidhya - Ultimate Student Hunt
This set of scripts is my solution for the Ultimate Student Hunt Challenge from Analyics Vidhya. With this analytic solution I was able to take the fifth place on the public leaderboard and in top 25 on the private leaderboard. The machine learning problem itself was regression based on panel data associated with public footfall in parks across the city at a daily frequency. The good public and private leaderboard results of the predictor were mainly based on the fact that the across cross-sectional unit aggregates helped with the quite prevalent missing feature problem.

The above scripts represent functions for -
- Data cleaning, Normalization, OHE
- Feature engineering, Imputation of NA values
- Aggregates, Rolling features, Seasonality etc. from time series perspective
- Feature engineering for weather prediliction based on temperature, humidity etc.
- XGB model fitting and generating submission files
